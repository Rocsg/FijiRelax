Programmers fluent with Java and Maven. Start by exploring the FijiRelax API: [API Overview](https://javadoc.io/doc/io.github.rocsg/fijirelax/latest/index.html). Build their own tools on top of the FijiRelax library, provided as a jar file hosted at maven central repository ([Artifact](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.github.rocsg/fijirelax)), by indicating FijiRelax as a dependency in your POM file and run the unit tests. FijiRelax is hosted on a github public repository ([https://github.com/rocsg/fijirelax](https://github.com/rocsg/fijirelax)) and developers can offer to contribute to its development, and extend it by requesting features, or proposing new features.
